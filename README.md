<h1>#DaysOfCode Challenge</h1>

<h5>100 Days of code by <a href="https://github.com/Kallaway" target="_blank">Alexander Kallaway</a></h5>

<p>A challenge that I decided to commit to in order to learn more to code and to make myself accountable. Already at Day 19 when I am writing this, I already log my daily progress on my <a href="https://twitter.com/LupchianCristi">Twitter Account</a>, updating when I have time on my <a href="https://cristilupchian.me/" target="_blank">personal website</a> and I will create a file with a daily log here inspired by <a href="https://github.com/Miffili">Klara's</a> approach and will be uploading my main projects built during the challenge. </p>
